Windows Phone app to "talk" using your phone display. 

Little oldschool type to communicate. Let imagine you are on concert where of course is very loud. You see someone who you want to meet. Talking to someone would be troublesome or maybe you are too shy to start a conversation. This app tries to address that problem. You write something in app and show it to the person you want to speak. Itâ€™s simply whiteboard. 

It was created because Windows Phone didn't have similar application as Android ecosystem had. And mainly it was created for fun :)
